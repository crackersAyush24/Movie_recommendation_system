Absolutely, Ayush! Here’s a professional and clear README for your Movie Recommendation System ML project. I’ve written it in a way that explains the project, dataset, setup, usage, and features. You can tweak it if needed.

🎬 Movie Recommendation System (ML Project)

Overview

This project is a Movie Recommendation System built using Machine Learning techniques. It analyzes movie metadata to provide personalized movie recommendations based on similarities in genres, keywords, cast, crew, and other attributes. The system is designed to help users discover movies they may like based on their preferences.

⸻

📂 Dataset

The dataset for this project is obtained from Kaggle:

TMDB Movie Metadata – Download here
	•	The dataset contains information about over 5,000 movies, including:
	•	Title
	•	Genres
	•	Overview
	•	Cast & Crew
	•	Keywords
	•	Release date
	•	Ratings

Make sure to download the dataset and place it in the dataset folder of this project. You may need to adjust the file path in the code depending on your project location.

⸻

🛠️ Features
	•	Recommend movies based on similar genres, keywords, and cast.
	•	Filter movies by popularity and ratings.
	•	Easy-to-use interface for exploring recommended movies.
	•	Can be extended with collaborative filtering or content-based filtering for improved recommendations.

⚙️ Installation & Setup
	1.	Clone the repository:

git clone <your-repo-link>
cd movie-recommendation-system

	2.	Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

	3.	Prepare dataset:

	•	Download TMDB Movie Metadata from Kaggle.
	•	Place movies.csv (or your dataset file) in the dataset/ folder.
	•	Update the file path in the notebook/script if necessary.

	4.	Run the project:

python movie_recommender.py

or open the Jupyter Notebook and run all cells.

⸻

🧩 How it Works
	1.	Data Preprocessing:
Clean the dataset, handle missing values, and extract relevant features like cast, crew, genres, and keywords.
	2.	Feature Engineering:
Combine text-based features into a single string for similarity computation.
	3.	Modeling:
	•	Use TF-IDF Vectorization for text features.
	•	Compute cosine similarity between movies to find recommendations.
	4.	Recommendations:
Input a movie title, and the system suggests a list of similar movies ranked by similarity scores.

⸻

💻 Usage
	1.	Run the script or notebook.
	2.	Enter a movie name in the input prompt.
	3.	View recommended movies along with their details.

Example:

Enter a movie name: The Dark Knight
Recommended Movies:
1. Batman Begins
2. The Dark Knight Rises
3. Joker
...

📚 Technologies Used
	•	Python 3
	•	Pandas for data manipulation
	•	Scikit-learn for TF-IDF vectorization and similarity computation
	•	Jupyter Notebook for experimentation

⸻

🔧 Future Enhancements
	•	Add user-based collaborative filtering for personalized recommendations.
	•	Integrate with a web interface using Streamlit or Flask.
	•	Include movie posters and trailers in recommendations.
	•	Support multi-language datasets.
